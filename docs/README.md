# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README is the main entrypoint for all project management process documents for OctoAcme.

## OctoAcme Project Management Processes (Summary)

OctoAcme delivers value through structured project management processes that ensure customer needs, iterative delivery, clear roles, measurable outcomes, and continuous improvement. Core practices include project initiation, planning, execution, release management, risk handling, and retrospectives, with a focus on transparency, stakeholder alignment, and actionable artifacts.

**Key Principles:**
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning

**Core Process Lifecycle:**
1. **Initiation** – problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline
2. **Planning** – scope, resources, milestones, dependencies
3. **Execution** – build, test, review, iterate
4. **Release** – deploy, verify, announce
5. **Close & Retrospective** – capture learnings and next steps
